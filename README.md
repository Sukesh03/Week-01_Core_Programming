## Overview

The objective of Week 1 is to introduce core programming concepts using the Java programming language. Learners will gain hands-on experience in writing basic Java programs and understanding how to manage data and control the flow of execution. The topics covered provide a foundation for future learning and application development.

## Topics Covered

### Day 1: Introduction to Java
- Overview and significance of Java
- Brief history of Java
- Installing and setting up the Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Writing and running a basic Java program ("Hello, World!")
- Understanding the structure of a Java program (classes, `main` method)

### Day 2: Variables, Data Types, and Operators
- Declaration and initialization of variables
- Primitive data types (`int`, `double`, `boolean`, `char`, etc.)
- Introduction to non-primitive data types (`String`)
- Java operators: arithmetic, relational, logical, and assignment
- Type casting and type conversion

### Day 3: Control Flow
- Conditional statements: `if`, `else if`, `else`
- `switch` statement
- Looping constructs: `for`, `while`, `do-while`
- Use of `break` and `continue` statements

### Day 4: Arrays
- Introduction to arrays
- Declaration and initialization of arrays
- Accessing and modifying array elements
- Iterating through arrays using loops
- Working with multi-dimensional arrays

### Day 5: Strings
- Understanding the `String` class
- Creating and manipulating `String` objects
- Common `String` methods: `length()`, `charAt()`, `substring()`, `equals()`, `equalsIgnoreCase()`
- String concatenation
- Concept of string immutability

### Day 6: Functions (Methods)
- Defining and invoking methods
- Method parameters and return values
- Method overloading
- Use of `static` and `void` keywords
- Benefits of modular programming
